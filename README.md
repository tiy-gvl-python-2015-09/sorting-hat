# ZAAAAAAAACH!
# Hogwarts Sorting Hat

## Description

The famous sorting hat from the Harry Potter literary universe is hanging up it's hat and heading into retirement. School
administrators decide it's more economically feasible to hire a data scientist (YOU!) to implement an algorithm to
sort incoming students into their respective houses.

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should understand:

* Advanced Classification methods

### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to:

* Perform classification with scikit-learn's built in classification algorithms

## Details

### Deliverables

* A Git repo called titanic containing at least:
  * `README.md` file explaining how to run your project
  * a `requirements.txt` file
  * an IPython Notebook file containing your model, results, and report.

### Requirements

* No PEP8 or Pyflakes warnings or errors

## Normal Mode

In this assignment you are provided a small slice of recent enrollment and grade statistics.  You will quickly
learn by using your intuition that certain Hogwarts Myers Briggs (don't worry it's different than the test us muggles take)
personality types "mesh" well with certain houses.  You will also notice that the previous sorting hat was pretty
terrible at it's job.

Your task is to read in and analyze your unique `_dataset.csv` file. Wrangle your data so that you can adequately train
your classifier to place students in a house they are a best fit for. Read in `_students_2016.csv` file and
add a `house` column to it and output it back to `_students_2016.csv`.

Use whatever methods you can find to best train and validate your classifiers are as awesome as they need to be. There
is no kaggle style automated score checking so have confidence in your classifier!

## Hard Mode

There is no hard mode for the assignment.
